# Model Parallelism Plan for NextGenJAX

## Overview

This document outlines the proposed architecture and API for implementing model parallelism features in NextGenJAX. The goal is to leverage JAX's parallelism capabilities to distribute model computations across multiple devices, similar to the approach used in the fairscale library for PyTorch.

## Key Components

### 1. VocabParallelEmbedding

The `VocabParallelEmbedding` class will parallelize the embedding layer in the vocabulary dimension. This is particularly useful for models with large vocabularies, as it allows for efficient memory usage and potentially faster computation.

### 2. ParallelEmbedding

The `ParallelEmbedding` class will parallelize the embedding layer in the embedding dimension. This approach can be beneficial when the embedding dimension is large, allowing for distributed computation of embeddings across multiple devices.

### 3. ColumnParallelLinear

The `ColumnParallelLinear` class will implement a linear layer with column parallelism. The weight matrix will be split along its second dimension (columns) across multiple devices. This approach is effective for layers with a large number of output features.

### 4. RowParallelLinear

The `RowParallelLinear` class will implement a linear layer with row parallelism. The weight matrix will be split along its first dimension (rows) across multiple devices. This approach is effective for layers with a large number of input features.

## API Design

### VocabParallelEmbedding

```python
class VocabParallelEmbedding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_embeddings: int, embedding_dim: int, init_method: Callable = jax.nn.initializers.normal()):
        self.num_embeddings = num_embeddings
        self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim
        self.init_method = init_method

    def __call__(self, input_ids: jnp.ndarray) -> jnp.ndarray:
        # Implementation of parallel embedding lookup
        pass
```

### ParallelEmbedding

```python
class ParallelEmbedding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_embeddings: int, embedding_dim: int, init_method: Callable = jax.nn.initializers.normal()):
        self.num_embeddings = num_embeddings
        self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim
        self.init_method = init_method

    def __call__(self, input_ids: jnp.ndarray) -> jnp.ndarray:
        # Implementation of parallel embedding lookup
        pass
```

### ColumnParallelLinear

```python
class ColumnParallelLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features: int, out_features: int, bias: bool = True, init_method: Callable = jax.nn.initializers.normal()):
        self.in_features = in_features
        self.out_features = out_features
        self.bias = bias
        self.init_method = init_method

    def __call__(self, input: jnp.ndarray) -> jnp.ndarray:
        # Implementation of column parallel linear layer
        pass
```

### RowParallelLinear

```python
class RowParallelLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features: int, out_features: int, bias: bool = True, init_method: Callable = jax.nn.initializers.normal()):
        self.in_features = in_features
        self.out_features = out_features
        self.bias = bias
        self.init_method = init_method

    def __call__(self, input: jnp.ndarray) -> jnp.ndarray:
        # Implementation of row parallel linear layer
        pass
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement the `VocabParallelEmbedding` class.
2. Implement the `ParallelEmbedding` class.
3. Implement the `ColumnParallelLinear` class.
4. Implement the `RowParallelLinear` class.
5. Write unit tests for each class to ensure correct functionality.
6. Integrate the parallel layers into the NextGenJAX model architecture.
7. Update the documentation to include usage examples for the parallel layers.

## Conclusion

The proposed model parallelism features will enhance the capabilities of NextGenJAX by enabling efficient distribution of model computations across multiple devices. This will allow for the development of more advanced and scalable neural network models.
