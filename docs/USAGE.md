# NextGenJAX Usage Guide

## Overview
NextGenJAX is a JAX-based neural network library designed to provide advanced features and flexibility for building and training machine learning models. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up, train, and use the NextGenJAX model.

## Installation
To install NextGenJAX, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/NextGenJAX.git
cd NextGenJAX
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Initialization
To initialize the NextGenJAX model, import the necessary modules and create an instance of the model:
```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from src.model import NextGenModel

# Define the model configuration
layers = [
    {'type': 'DenseLayer', 'features': 128, 'activation': jnp.relu},
    {'type': 'DenseLayer', 'features': 64, 'activation': jnp.relu},
    {'type': 'DenseLayer', 'features': 10, 'activation': None}
]

# Initialize the model
model = NextGenModel()
model.setup(layers)
```

## Training the Model
To train the model, use the `train_model` function from the `train.py` module. This function requires the training data, optimizer, and loss function as inputs:
```python
from src.train import train_model
from src.optimizers import sgd

# Define the training data
X_train = jnp.ones((100, 20))  # Example input data
y_train = jnp.ones((100, 10))  # Example target data

# Define the optimizer and loss function
optimizer = 'sgd'
loss_fn = lambda logits, labels: jnp.mean((logits - labels) ** 2)

# Train the model
state, metrics = train_model(model, layers, X_train, y_train, num_epochs=10, learning_rate=0.01, optimizer=optimizer, loss_fn=loss_fn)
print(f"Final training metrics: {metrics}")
```

## Using the Trained Model
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data:
```python
# Define new input data
X_new = jnp.ones((10, 20))  # Example new input data

# Make predictions
predictions = model.apply(state.params, X_new)
print(predictions)
```
