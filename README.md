## Overview
NextGenJAX is an advanced neural network library built on top of JAX, designed to surpass the capabilities of existing libraries such as Google DeepMind's Haiku and Optax. It leverages the flexibility and performance of JAX and Flax to provide a modular, high-performance, and easy-to-use framework for building and training neural networks.

## Framework Compatibility
NextGenJAX now supports both TensorFlow and PyTorch, allowing users to choose their preferred deep learning framework. This compatibility enables seamless integration with existing TensorFlow or PyTorch workflows while leveraging the advanced features of NextGenJAX.

## Features
- Modular design with customizable layers and activation functions
- Support for various optimizers, including custom optimizers
- Flexible training loop with support for custom loss functions
- Integration with JAX and Flax for high performance and scalability
- Comprehensive test suite to ensure model correctness and performance

## Installation
To install NextGenJAX, you can use pip:
```bash
pip install nextgenjax
```

For development, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/NextGenJAX.git
cd NextGenJAX
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

NextGenJAX now supports both TensorFlow and PyTorch. To use these frameworks, make sure to install them separately:

For TensorFlow:
```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

For PyTorch:
```bash
pip install torch
```

## Usage
NextGenJAX now supports both TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. Users can choose their preferred framework when initializing the model.

### Creating a Model
To create a model using NextGenJAX, choose your framework and initialize the model:

```python
from src.model import NextGenModel

# Initialize the model with TensorFlow
tf_model = NextGenModel(framework='tensorflow', num_layers=6, hidden_size=512, num_heads=8, dropout_rate=0.1)

# Initialize the model with PyTorch
pytorch_model = NextGenModel(framework='pytorch', num_layers=6, hidden_size=512, num_heads=8, dropout_rate=0.1)
```

### Training the Model
The training process remains similar for both frameworks. Here's an example using TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from src.train import create_train_state, train_model

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

# Create the training state
train_state = create_train_state(tf_model, optimizer)

# Define the training data and loss function
train_data = ...  # Your training data here
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()

# Train the model
train_model(train_state, train_data, loss_fn, num_epochs=10)
```

For PyTorch, the process is similar, but you'll use PyTorch-specific optimizers and loss functions.

Note: The core functionality remains the same for both frameworks, allowing users to leverage either TensorFlow or PyTorch based on their preference or specific use case.

## Development Setup
To set up a development environment:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install development dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
3. Run tests using pytest: `pytest tests/`

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Our CI/CD workflow runs tests on Python 3.9 to ensure compatibility and code quality.
